    <p>Hi, my name is Khen Aldrich Quezon, I'm 18 years old and currently living in my aunt's
           house at Labangon Optima, being able to go to college is already a big blessing for me,
           but deciding what course I should take was one of the challenging part of going to college, 
           because most of my family asks me "Why did you chose the course BSIT?" it hits me everytime 
           they question me about my course, and my answer is always "no choice" or "hilig man kos computer"
           but deep inside, I have my own reason that I can't even comprehend because of the pressure in the
           family and to other people. This course was my second opinion next to Psychology, IT is the only 
           course that my family approved and due to financial reasons, but deep inside, I really want to
           pursue this course because I can see myself as a developer in the future and i know this cours
           e will challenge my critical thinking skills, being patient, and many more to uncover. I promise 
           to myself and to my family that I will do everything that I can to finish my academics, because
           I want to repay all the kindness and love that they have given to me. I know reaching my goals
           are not easy as dreaming of it, but all and all I will do my very best to reach the end of this
           chapter and make my family proud of what i will achieve.</p>

    <p>Dreaming of something big is not easy, not because it feels impossible to accomplish, but because it 
           is the one that I really want in my life, and the feeling that you're failing your parents and 
           yourself is one of the scariest things that can happen to me. Thankfully I have someone that inspires
           me to do my very best in school, to be the best version of myself than I am yesterday, because of
           that person, I realised that I needed to change for the better and also for the future that I seek.
           Failing is scary but failing while not being in your full potential is more disappointing,
           that is why changing oneself is the best way to success. i want to graduate this course not only 
           to make my family proud, but also my past self and say to myself that "we've come far and achieved great
           things in life" just imagining that word makes me excite about my future and what comes next to my life.
           The future awaits us and the present is our guide to what comes next....</p>
